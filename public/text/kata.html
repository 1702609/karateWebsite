Katas are a sequence of movements that need to be memorised by every karateka. It can be seen as fighting with an invisible opponent but the attacks, blocks and stances are perfectly synchronised. The timing of each movement of the Kata has to be followed strictly; moves can involve slow-motion and others fast-paced. To improve one's kata performance, Karateka must perform kata on repeatedly. If a Karateka wants to perform kata at the best performance, they must display smooth transition and flow from one posture and movement to another. This makes it entertaining for people to watch since it shows the power and discipline that Shotokan karate has to offer.
