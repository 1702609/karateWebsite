				What is Karate?
			</h1>
		
			<p>
				Shotokan karate is a style of karate, developed from various martial arts by Gichin Funakoshi. 
				It teaches karateka how to self-defend and be disciplined. Karate consists of <b>3 Ks</b> which are Kata, 
				Kumite and Kihon. Katas are sequences of karate moves that karateka must memorise and execute them.
				Whilst executing those moves, the karateka must pay attention to their form and timing. Kumite 
				refers to sparring, this allows karateka to work on their blocks and their attack's precision. 
				Lastly, Kihon is the repetition of performing basic karate movements; this includes doing several 
				numbers of punches or kicks. This allows karateka to perfect their basic movements and stance.
